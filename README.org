* SBCL Speedrun Timer
This is a complete rewrite of my first Lisp project: a speedrun timer. It uses ncurses and a SQLite database, with the [[https://github.com/fukamachi/mito][MITO ORM.]]
** Requirements
+ [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp]]
+ [[http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html][SBCL]]
** Usage
*** Importing categories
Config files are documented by the examples in ~configs~. Once a config file is written, import that category and its splits by running ~sbcl --load main.lisp -i <path-to-config>~. This will add the category and its splits to the timer's SQLite database.
*** Running
Simply ~sbcl --load main.lisp~
